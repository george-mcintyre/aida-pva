#  Abs:   ORBACUS configs for AIDA DpCaServer 
#
#  Name:  DpCaServer.conf
#
#  Rem:   Configures Orbacus ORB and/or POAs.
# 
#  Usage: See ORBACUS manual. Now loaded by specifying 
#         -Dooc.config=<filename>.conf Java Property, which is 
#         passed to ORB by call to ORB.init(appargs, Properties)
#
#  Side:  For AIDA these options are most important because without the
#         ooc.orb.oa.endpoint=iiop --port <portnum> config the 
#         Aida servants would be brought up on different ports on every
#         restart, so they would not be "PERSISTENT" servers. It's very 
#         important that they are persistent servers, so that when they're
#         restared clients (and other servers) don't have to be restarted too.
