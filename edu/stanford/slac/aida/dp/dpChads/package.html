    Defines the java binding for the EPICS Archiver AIDA 
    Data Provider's API.
    
    dpChads, the EPICS Archiver AIDA Data Provider, is actually
    implemented in c++. However, since the data provider uses a CORBA IDL defined
    type, histdata, to return its data, Java clients need
    the jidl (java idl) output generated for it mainpulate a histdata. That output
    is kept in this package. Note, no CVSed source code is
    needed for this package, since it's entirely defined
    by its Makefile, which runs jidl on dpChads.idl.
