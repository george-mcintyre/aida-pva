 Illustrates a Java data provider constructing
 and returning structured aggregate data (see get method) using an ad-hoc
 IDL defined  structure, as opposed to using Aida's DaValue mechanism. 

This is java code complimentary to the example of <code>$AIDA/src/epics/extensions/src/dp/dpChads</code> which demonstrates the same data provider problem in c++. This server is maintained in addition
to dpChads as a speed reference and java code example.
