    Defines the Aida API objects a client program
uses to interact with Aida, <code>DaObject</code> and <code>DaReference</code>.

<p><code>DaObject</code> is the basic Aida API. That is, application programs can use 
methods of <code>DaObject</code> to get data and update databases with new data. An
application program gets data by calling a <code>DaObject</code> method with a query
string, or using a <code>DaReference</code> object.</P>

<p>A <code>DaReference</code> object is basically a compiled query. It is used to speed up
the execution of repeated requests for operations, like get, or set, on the 
same data items.</p>
