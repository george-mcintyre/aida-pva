Defines the abstract data types that define the callable interfaces of the peers in an 
Aida network (most importantly the Data Provider peers).

<p><code>AidaObjectI</code> is the abstract interface which defines the API of 
an Aida Data Provider. Specifically, each data provider is no more than an 
implementation of an
AidaObjectI. Recall, in the Aida naming convention, the I sufix denotes
an interface, either implemented by CORBA (as in this case), or a Java
"interface".</p>
<p>However, the mechanism in which this comes about is quite tricky:
<code>AidaObjectI</code> is defined, using CORBA, as an IDL 
interface in <code>/idl/aidaObject.idl</code>. The output of the jidl compile of
that file, is used in two
ways:
<dl>
<dt>To construct each Data Provider's basic CORBA interface code:<br>
<dd>
When gmake is run on the makefile <code>makefileAida.sun4</CODE> to build a 
given Data Provider, it runs
jidl on <code>aidaObject.idl</code>. That idl file contains a
<CODE>module</CODE> definition named "dp", and interface "aidaObjectI". jidl
creates the CORBA support files for the interface so defined, and the
 template _impl file of a template data provider, calling it <code>aidaObjectI_*</code> 
(constructing a template <code>aidaObjectI_impl</code> in particular). The next
part of this build sequence, as implemented in the rules in the Makefile.sun4 of
Data Provider, is to literally <code>sed</code> the output of jidl and change
all instances of <code>aidaObjectI</code> to <code><i>dataprovdiernameI
</i></code>. See, for instance, <code>/dp/dpCa/Makefile.sun4</code>. The "dp" is
changed to the given Data Provider's package name, and the interface to the 
Data Provider's name (these two may be the same). The output of the jidl is left
in this directory (<code>util.dp</code>), whereas the output from teh subsequent
sed is left in the Data Provider's package directory.
<dt>Used by the Aida API objects to interact with Aida peers: <br>
<dd>The Aida API objects, <code>DaObject</code> and <code>DaReference</code>, 
through which DaServer or an application programs calls Data Providers, 
 actually understand each 
peer through private member data defined as <code>aidaObjectI</code> and 
<code>aidaObjectRef</code>. In this way, the DaServer and client programs can
call a Data Provider peer without actually having instantiated an instance
of the interface object for that Data Provider by name. For instance, they can 
call methods of Data Provider <code>dpCa</code> without having to construct a 
an object of <code>dpCaI</code> by just calling methods on an
<code>aidaObjectI</code>.  
</dl>

<p><code>AidaObjectRef</code> is used by the Aida API object
<code>DaReference</code>, to hold the run-time information about the
Data Providers needed to satisfy a query. Specifically, it contains the 
infomation relating to servers, such as IORs and necessary output ordering, for 
the compiled query encapsulated in a
<code>DaReference</code>.</p>

<h3>Makefiles for making Data Providers</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Makefile
<dd>Makes each of Makefile1, Makefile2, Makefile3 in order.
<dt>Makefile1
<dd>Makes <code>lib/dp</code> itself.
<dt>Makefile2
<dd>Makes aidaObjectRef.
<dt>Makefile3
<dd>Makes aidaObject.
</dl>
