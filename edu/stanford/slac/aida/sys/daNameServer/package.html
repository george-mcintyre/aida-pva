    Defines Aida's Directory Service server.

<p>This package defines the Aida peer <code>DaNameServerI</code>. 
The "main" program of
daNameServer is <code>NameServer</code>, which hosts a <code>DaNameServerI</code>.
</p>
<p>
This is the
special Aida peer which
acts as Aida's Directory Service. The Aida API objects, <code>DaObject</code>
and <code>Dareference</code>, call methods of <code>DaNameServerI_impl</code> to
discover the Data Providers necessary to satisfy the Aida query they are
processing. The Directory Service information is 
stored in an external SQL database, which <code>DaNameServerI_impl</code>
accesses to retrieve information about each entity/attribute "known" by Aida.
</p>
<p>In addition to its function as a Directory Service for data,
<code>daNameServerI</code> acts as a Name Server for all Aida peers. That is,
each peer in the Aida network; each Data Provider, and <code>DaServer</code>,
tells <code>DaNameServerI</code> its CORBA IOR (Interoperable Object Reference)
when it initializes. Each Aida peer, and each client program, discovers the IOR
of any
peer by asking <code>DaNameServer</code>. With the IOR of a peer, the program (peer or
client) can 
contact it directly. The most important example of this is when a client
application program constructs a new Aida API object <code>DaObject</code>. At
that time, <code>DaObject</code> contacts the NameServer
(<code>NameServer</code> deploys a <code>DaNameServerI</code>) to find out the
IOR of the DaServer - the Aida peer which processes queries for client programs.
From that point on, <code>DaObject</code> uses <code>DaNameServerI</code> in 
its capacity as a Directory Service to translate requests for entity/attribute
pairs into specific queries against Aida Data Providers (see above).
