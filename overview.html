  Aida is middleware - it connects application programs, to data providers. 

It is also language independent - the data providers' APIs may be in
c++ or java. As presently implemented, the AIDA API, how client programs 
connect to Aida, is only implemeted in Java, though we do have plans to create
a c++ API for Aida too.

AIDA itself, what lies between its API and its data providers, is java. This is
documented in JavaDoc here. Additionally, the Data Providers which implemented 
in Java re documented here. 

<h2>The AIDA System</h2>
AIDA consists of 3 groups of java packages:
<table border='1' title='The package groups that comprise Aida'>
<TR>
<TD>edu.stanford.slac.aida.lib.*</TD>
<TD>The Aida smarts. <code>lib.da</code> defines the Aida API - what a programmer
uses to get data. <CODE>lib.dp</CODE>
defines the abstract Aida <q>data provider</q> base classes and interfaces, <code>AidaObjectI
 </CODE> and <code>AidaObjectRef</code>. <CODE>lib.util</CODE> is where all 
of the private classes that make up the Aida core reside, particularly <code>lib.util.common</CODE>.
This group of packages is where a programmer of the Aida system itself will spend most of their time.</TD>
</tr>
<tr>
<TD>edu.stanford.slac.aida.sys.*</TD>
<TD>Defines the CORBA server objects for the two Aida servers - daServer and 
daNameServer</TD>
</TR>
<tr>
<TD>edu.stanford.slac.aida.dp.*</TD>
<TD>Defines the Aida Data Providers. This is where a programmer who wants to
add a new source from which Aida is to get data, would add a new package.</TD>
</TR>
<tr>
<TD>test.java.*</TD>
<TD>Defines a test and demo suite for Aida. Check out <code>Tests.java</code> for an overview test set,
plus test code for each Data Provider.</TD>
